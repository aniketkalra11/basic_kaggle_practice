    "to perform incremental learning, Scikit-learn implements  ```partial_fit``` method that hels in training an out-of-memory dataset. In otherwords, it has the ability to learn incrementally from a batch of instances.<br><br>\n",
    "In this colab, we will see an example of how to read, process, and train on such a large dataset that can't be loaded in memeory entirely.<br><br>\n",
    "This method is expected to be called several times consecutively on different chunks of a dataset so as to implement out-of-core(online) learning. This function has some performance overhead, so it's recommended to call it on a considerable large batch of data(that fits into the memory), to overcomethe limitation of overhead."
