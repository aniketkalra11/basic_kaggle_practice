All the experienced players stood up at the right time and won us the game. Looking at how the tournament has gone for us, batting second in the first five games and then we had to bat first here, we were challenged. We knew the pitch had something in it and we had the experience in our bowling, so we wanted to get to a decent total. We were not great with the bat, losing three wickets in the first powerplay isn't the ideal situation. You have to then create a long partnership, which we did. But then we just lost wickets, including mine. Looking at the overall picture, I thought we were 30 runs short. [On India's bowling] You don't see that every day when you are defending such a total. Our seamers exploited the conditions very well, there was swing and lateral movement available. [Do India have all the variety in their attack?] I think so, we have got a good balance there. A couple of good spinners and seamers bringing in their experience.

[Did it make sense to absorb pressure after early wickets?] I think whichever way you want to go, you have to be committed. It's all about execution. It is. The answer is on a postcard, I think. It was a great start in the powerplay by the bowlers, the guys found some movement. The ground fielding was good. But the way we batted, we didn't back that up.

We knew the pitch had something in it and we had the experience in our bowling, so we wanted to get to a decent total. We were not great with the bat, losing three wickets in the first powerplay isn't the ideal situation. You have to then create a long partnership, which we did. But then we just lost wickets, including mine. Looking at the overall picture, I thought we were 30 runs short. [On India's bowling] You don't see that every day when you are defending such a total. Our seamers exploited the conditions very well, there was swing and lateral movement available. [Do India have all the variety in their attack?] I think so, we have got a good balance there.
