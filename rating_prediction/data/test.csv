Sadly, I should have tried the recipe first as written but so many said that additional sauce was needed.  So rather than double the ingredients, I did a 1.5X the amounts and had enough sauce to sufficiently cover the potatoes.  After an hour, I removed the foil and there was so much sauce/juice that the dish was swimming in liquid.  I literally spooned out all of the extra sauce which easily made up the extra 1/2 that I added.  The potatoes were very tender (used a mandolin for thinner slices) and the sauce was a hit -- delicious.  Next time I would brown the chops and only add to the dish at the last 30 minutes of cooking.  I used 1 inch chops and they turned out dryer than I&#39;d like.

Before adding the cream, I put half of the blended mix into a freezer container and allow it to cool completely before freezing.

I was dissapointed by that happening and wondered if anyone has a solution to keeping the top icing layer from breaking into many pieces and not sticking to the caramel layer? I followed the directions completely and also followed what the reviewer, spoir10692 wrote on December 22, 2010 to keep the top icing layer from spliting/cracking, and it still didn&#39;t work. I also had a problem of cutting it into nice square pieces since the caramel layer was hard to cut through and it came out in jagged edges. It didn&#39;t look like the evenly cut pieces in the picture at all and I found it took me a long time to made it.  Well, after all this, I still will keep trying to make this turn out right since it was SO delicious and adictive!"

Are you using butter with your crumbs-most margarines today contain water which could be causing the soggy problem. Also, you are leaving the foil loose, right so that cooking is aided, but steam escapes? I&#39;m going to try dipping the breast halves in skim milk and then in panko crumbs to see how that turns out. (Panko crumbs are coarser, crisper bread crumbs that allow you to bake things with a crispy coating without frying. It is a newer product here in the US)"

But my husband and I really did like this a lot. My teenage boys thought it was fine but they don&#39;t like Mexican food that much. I used bonafide organic bone broth that you buy in the freezer section. Traditional beef and chicken broth that you buy on the shelf is not good for you at all and has WAY too much salt. I also didn&#39;t add the salt in the recipe as other reviewers suggested. The salt flavor was perfect. My husband also bought the HUGE tortillas so I still had to cut them off because it was too much tortilla. I used 7 tortillas but they I cut about 1/3 off of them. I put in a little over 1/2 cup meat in each of them and also used a lot more cheese in the recipe and on top. We loved the jalapeños and red onion on the top. I wish I put avocado on top too. The flavor was great. There was a ton of sauce and we love sauce. Great meal.

Dont bake the bread until the bread has risen to the top of the pan, but not over, otherwise the little it will rise in the oven heat will spill too far over the pan.   Carrie, sugar is the simplest of the &#39;starches&#39; that yeast needs to form, you can use honey or even corn starch,  sugar just allows the yeast to propagate fastest.  if you use honey or starch it will take longer.  if you use these let the yeast work on the liquid mix before adding to the flour, that gives them the boost needed to really work into the flour.

As an experienced baker, I can make numerous modifications with a recipe this basic. To answer some other concerns, it is helpful to start with the yeast and two cups of flour and add the liquid ingredients before you add salt and let sit about ten minutes. This fully activated the yeast and can improve results. To the person whose bread came out doughy, have you confirmed your oven temperature is accurate? Often, home ranges can vary in actual temperature."

For the second pan, I transferred them as soon as they came out of the oven, and it was no trouble at all.

I did add some balsamic vinegar to the bruschetta on the suggestions of several reviewers, making it more like authentic bruschetta.

I halved the recipe since there was only two of us, but I did make the whole recipe of the bruschetta.  I tossed the extra onto some angel hair pasta and it made a nice side for the chicken.

It is fusion cooking. This is Tex-Mex cuisine which obviously has been tweaked from traditional Mexican food made to please those North of the border.  Here, in Texas, people put beef in just about everything.  We always use cheese in our rellenos and enchiladas.Traditional enchiladas are made with corn tortillas as the author noted.The sauce recipe here is very much the same as canned sauce in that both use tomato products.  I can tell you with authority that most restaurants and Mexican homes such as ours never use tomato products in our enchilada sauce.   California, Northern and Central Mexico don&#39;t use tomatoes in this way traditionally.As we live in Texas, I encounter all sorts of deviations from traditional Mexican food.  Some are o.k. but hubby will not eat enchiladas anywhere but at home due to the fact he is always disappointed in their preparation.   The same is true with many Mexican families here.For my enchilada sauce I only use diced onion cooked in oil until transparent, then I add the flour and spices to create a roux and cook for at least 4 minutes.   I then add the broth (Better Than Bouillon Chicken) and simmer for 30 minutes.  I don&#39;t add salt as there is enough in the broth.  My spice mixture is secret and handed down so I will not offer it here."

The crust could have baked about 3-4 minutes longer but that may have been my oven. I took this to a potluck without having made the recipe before; that&#39;s always a gamble! I received numerous compliments and a few requests for the recipe. Tell-tale vote was in the fact that I took home an empty pan! The bars were sweet but the tartness of the rhubarb balances it out and dessert was light tasting. I also appreciated that real whipped cream and not artificial topping was used. It gave the bars a richer taste than the artificial plastic tasting topping would.

Both times, I just realized,  I failed to bake the crust, and it obviously turned out great anyway. The 2nd time, I wanted more custardy filling, so added 1/4 cup milk., too.  We had a house-full of people, so it makes enough. I will be bringing this to pot-lucks, for sure.  It certainly was NOT bland.  We used freshly picked rhubarb. We all loved the shortbread crust. I feel this was an easy recipe and quick, but then, I had my rhubarb already cut and didn&#39;t bake the crust before adding the filling. It tastes more custardy when eaten warm. It sets up a bit when chilled. It would be yummy even without the topping, I am sure. A big hit, here!"

Very goood.  By the way the batch does need to be doubled when you cook the recipe. The first batch I cook as according to the recipe they were excellent but the egg white seem to run out of the cookie. The next batch I beat the egg white slightly and added a little coconut flavoring alone with the vanilla. They came out perfect and tasted a little better. This is a delicious cookie. The first batch I removed from the oven 1 hour ago and my husband has eaten almost half of the first batch.

I&#39;d always considered that doing anything to grapes except eating them right off the bunch was gilding the lily, but after tasting this, I decided if you are going to &#34;gild,&#34; this was the gilding to do! I&#39;d never made this myself before today, though. We had a bunch of white grapes that were just a bit too tart for us to enjoy eating by themselves, so I mixed this up. It&#39;s so quick and so easy, and very forgiving of substitutions--I found that I didn&#39;t have sour cream, so used 0% plain Greek yogurt, and then discovered that I&#39;d accidentally grabbed fat free cream cheese at the store, which is a slightly different creature to me than regular or lowfat. And I had no pecans, so I chopped up some almonds. Even with all that, this came out wonderfully, and tasted very similar to what I&#39;ve had in the past at various gatherings."

I also added a bit of brown sugar to cut the salt and acidity. Next time I would half the amount of salt. On its own it was WAY too salty. Thankfully the toppings masked the saltiness.

Just a couple things that you need to know.  The bake time at the top says 70 mins and in the recipe itself it says 1 hr 20 mins or until the tooth pick comes out clean.  I have made this 3 times and it takes about 60 mins at the most at 325 degrees.  Let the bread rest in the pan for 5-10 mins thing remove and cool on a cooling rack.  The bottom tends to stick a little when using a spray so use shortening or butter to grease the pan.

Definitely use rice vinegar in place of white, as well as chili sauce in place of ketchup. The five spice is a must for fabulous flavor, (freeze spice for later repeat meals if nothing else). We do add a bit more red pepper for extra heat. Also, no need for the extra step of cornstarch slurry. Just mix that in with the rest of ingredients, and pour over chicken, and simmer 20 minutes. Oh, and double the sauce. So yummy over the rice."

I&#39;ve done lots of different cakes, pies, and cupcakes, but I&#39;ve been a limited intimidated with the apple pie. Well, my son wanted an apple pie for his birthday and so, it was the right time to just go for it. I chose this recipe because it was simple and straightforward. I did read through many of the reviews, which are very mixed--from best pie to worst pie. Honestly, that made me a little nervous, but I decided to remain positive and give it a shot. The result was spectacular!!! I had my son eat the first piece and he was incredibly happy. He said it was the best pie he has ever had and went back for a 2nd even bigger slice. I took the next slice, and I was also impressed with just how good it tasted and how  well everything came out.  I will note that I followed the directions, without any changes. I used only Granny Smith apples and I didn&#39;t have any issues with the filling becoming too liquidy or the apples not baking well enough. The pie&#39;s taste is amazing. I thought the proportion of the spices was completely appropriate so no one spice stood out too harshly. Honestly, the hardest part for me was making the crust, which I also decided to do for the first time. I was actually worried most about the double crust, but it somehow all worked out. Phew! I would definitely recommend this recipe. It&#39;s worth taking a chance."

I just use chicken, and chicken broth, salt, pepper, butter. For dumplings I use self-rising flour, small amount of shortening (about the size of a small egg) and water. mix this up till stiff.  Cut in strips or pinch off,) I pinch mine, then Add to boiling broth.  You can continue to add them even when they cover the top. Just take a spoon and put them down, keep adding as long as you can or want to. you will have to make more than one batch of dough.  I usually make 3 batches and use a 6Qt pot. But be careful, they will boil over.  When you are done adding dough, turn heat down, and continue to cook until they are shiny.  Then they are done.  If you want them like a biscuit inside, make bigger pieces to drop in. When you get enough dough, it will thicken itself. I you get it to thick, and more broth, or water.  Serve with Cornbread"

Basil, oregano. Garlic, salt and black pepper. A can of paste added to the sauce. Simmer until it bubbles like the old mud pots at Disneyland. Top the zucchini layer with sauce, top with hamburger, veg and cheese and that should bring this home. I’ve been making pizza for 50 years, trust me this works. Otherwise it’s a great recipe and the zucchini rocks! Love keto."

Instead of hot fudge topping stirred into the chocolate layer, I melted dark chocolate into some milk and stirred it into 1/3 of the batter. I left 1/3 plain, and I stirred the peanut butter into the other 1/3. I layered them in the pan, chocolate on bottom, plain in the middle, and PB on top. I baked it about an hour and 10 minutes. Tomorrow I&#39;ll melt chocolate in milk again and put it on top as a ganache, with PB cups chopped on top.

Yes, you can use cornstarch instead of the flour.  The consistency will be a tad different but it will taste just as good! One of my favorite gluten free substitutes for wheat flour in recipes is Bob&#39;s Red Mill Gluten Free All Purpose Flour.  It contains a blend of five different gluten free flours that makes an EXCELLENT substitute in all your recipes.   *Note:  you would use the cornstarch or the GF AP Flour in equal measures to replace the wheat flour."

I use a combination of sharp and mild cheddars instead of Velveeta, and I use a combination of peeled russet (all purpose) potatoes and unpeeled Yukon gold potatoes as I like the different textures.  Sour cream is not something that I keep on hand, so I rarely add it in.  We drink fat free milk, so I often use that instead of buying whole milk  just for using in this recipe.   To change things up from time to time, in place of ground beef, I’ve used both ground and link sausages (sliced thin) and cubed ham.  I’ve also left the meat out altogether and doubled the potatoes.  When using ground meat, I typically use a whole pound instead of a half pound.  Any way I make it, we like to sprinkle some bacon on top!  Enjoy!"

I used cake flour and subbed hot dark roast coffee in place of the boiling water, and also sifted the dry ingredients to be sure all of the lumps were out, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  After adding the hot coffee the batter was really thin. I&#39;ve never made a cake with such runny batter before and was a little nervous about it.  I baked 2 layers on the top rack and 1 on the bottom rack.  The top rack cakes were ready at the 30 minute mark so I pulled them out.The cake that had been on the bottom rack was still liquid in the middle, so I moved it to the top rack and baked it another 7 or 8 minutes.  The top of that 3rd layer had a funny darkened pupil-in-an-eyeball sort of center appearance, probably from the jiggling it received when I moved it to the top rack, but it was fully baked and unnoticeable once it was frosted.  I made my own frosting (a butter &amp; cocoa powder version) that I know is delicious, since some folks mentioned they didn&#39;t like the sour cream flavored icing much.  The cake had a nice dense, moist texture and a great not-too-chocolatey flavor.  It makes a huge cake; mine was 4&#34; tall when assembled, so be sure to cut thin slices!  I will save this to bake again- we shared a huge chunk with the neighbors and are still enjoying leftovers!"

I followed the recipe ingredients exactly other than upgrading by using portobello mushrooms. Procedure-wise: I sliced two 8-oz. chicken breasts lengthwise rather than pound them to 1/4&#34; thickness. Doing that saved a little effort and it did not at all impact the taste. This recipe can make a novice cook look like a seasoned pro. It was flavorful, juicy and the two of us could have easily eaten the other two servings. :)  I will definitely be making this again.  I liked the idea shared in the reviews of sauteing the onions. I&#39;m also toying with the idea of using half chicken broth and half white wine for the sauce mixture.  To answer &#34;Lousey Cook in Texas&#39; question: I don&#39;t know that it would taste as good as making it fresh. The breading on the chicken might get a bit soggy. You could try it but it really doesn&#39;t take long to put this all together."

I ended up leaving it in the mixing bowl to soften up the oats for Maybe 5-10 minutes while I started coffee and then threw that batter on a griddle, cooked those puppies up, and inhaled 3 while they were still warm and covered in smashed strawberries and blackberries. The recipe made 9 good-sized pancakes that were soft, fluffy, and tasted a little like banana bread. I’m sold."

When it is their turn to cook we usually use three cans of cubed potatoes and skip the fresh ones.  We usually use matchstick carrots so we don&#39;t have to chop.  IF we use bacon we use real bacon pieces (such as Hormel) like you can find in the salad section of the store.  We usually saute the carrot and onion in olive oil since I don&#39;t have bacon grease to use.  Because I use canned potatoes I only heat it through before I add the ham and cheese.  The whole family loves this recipe and it is not unusual to make a double recipe so that we can enjoy it as leftovers.

We use only 1 can of cherry filling--I cannot imagine how wet it would be with 2 cans.  Try using an apricot pie filling for another very special treat.   Haven&#39;t made them for quite some time but we all cut them to be a generous size so the yield is not 60 out of a jelly roll size pan.farmerjoy

I ended up baking for 6 minutes and letting cool on the cookie sheet for 1.5 minutes before removing to a wire rack. They didn&#39;t really spread at all.

First and foremost, if you follow my recommendations, you will not have any problems at all, despite what others say here.  What I did is use Reynolds (brand) Release Foil (make sure dull side is facing up) in the 10X15X1 pan.  MAKE SURE YOU LEAVE ENOUGH FOIL HANGING OVER THE SHORT ENDS TO LIFT THE COOKIES OUT OF THE PAN LATER.  I ALSO sprayed it with nonstick cooking spray very lightly.  I made sure all of the graham crackers fit properly in the pan (trim using a paring knife if need be--it&#39;s much easier than you think).  Once the crackers are in the pan properly, I did use more than two cups of mini marshmallows...probably 2-1/2 cups total--enough to cover all of the crackers sufficiently.  Then what I did is I used 1 cup of butter and 1 cup of light brown (not dark brown) sugar.  Make sure you use real butter and fresh brown sugar.  I cooked it precisely 1 minute after the butter melted.  I think what a lot of cooks are doing is cooking the butter and brown sugar mixture too long.  This will cause the cookies to not turn out like they are supposed to (I know from experience).  I used 1-1/2 teaspoons of GOOD cinnamon (like Penzey&#39;s Celyon) and good, double strength vanilla extract.  I also put a PINCH (no more) of salt in the caramel mixture.  When it is cooked, I transferred the entire caramel mixture into a Pyrex measuring cup and poured it very carefully over the marshmallows so nothing puddled.  Then I topped with the coconut and almonds and baked for 12 minutes and then checked it.  My oven tends to be a bit psychotic, so it only takes about one minute more in mine to brown.  When you take the cookies out of the oven, you will see that the marshmallows look like they are not cooked all the way.  Don&#39;t worry.  They will finish melting when you take them out of the oven.  Remove pan from oven and place on a towel on table or counter for five minutes.  Then lift cookies out by short ends with the foil overhang and place back on table or counter for five minutes or so (depends on temperature in your house at the time).  Then lightly spray a large pizza cutter with nonstick spray and use the pizza cutter to slice through the cookies--don&#39;t remove from pan right away--just slice.  Then let cool completely and put in a very loosely covered container.  They won&#39;t last long enough to go stale.  Not to worry.  People are having problems with these cookies because, I think, they are cooking the caramel way too long.  Even a minute too long is tooo long.  I hope this helps you guys so that you will try it--even try it again, if you didn&#39;t like the way they turned out the first time.  Happy baking!"

The 1st time I tried the recipe I used an 11 cup pyrex dish as I saw that it made a really big loaf. I started to moniter the baking process at approx. 1 hr and tested center with a toothpick.

I had a problem getting my diced potatoes to consistently soften up so the next time I make it I will be sure to cook them in a separate pan and add them in at the last minute with the cheese and ham.  This was a good use of some leftover ham steak and I also had two leftover ears of sweet corn I used rather than the canned corn.  I could have used an extra ear.  My only other substitution was to use two 4 oz blocks of Velveeta cheese cubed up as I did not have shredded cheese on hand and this melts in better anyway.  It is tasty and no celery that my husband would prefer I not use!

I didn&#39;t have green chiles, so I added two (Drained!!!) cans of Diced tomatoes with green chiles (one mild and one &#34;Mexican&#34; flavored, YUM!) Also, I had 2 cans of Canellini beans (white kidney beans) instead of great northern. As far as spice...

So yummy! It was so fancy when sliced and displayed and all my close friends were demanding slices as soon as they saw it. My dessert was the first to go and EVERYONE declared it to be one of the best chocolate cakes they had ever had. The balance of the sour cream with the sugar kept it from being overwhelmingly sweet and it was more old school in recipe without the white sugar and with the boiling water and sour cream. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the semi-sweet bakers chocolate. The frosting is plentiful and delicious. And for a garnish, I crushed up some chocolate chips and dusted the top. It was a massive hit. Everyone declared it to be so moist and to taste like it came from a bakery. Definitely an awesome cake. Will be making it again for Thanksgiving."

I did not have chicken thighs on hand so I used chicken breasts - I used 1.5 pounds. I added 2 cups of gluten free penne pasta.  Along with the spices (except red pepper flakes) mentioned to use I also added Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb and black  pepper - did not measure just eyed it when added. I also added 1 cup of sodium free chicken broth due to the extra half cup of pasta. Cooked as instructed and the remaining uncovered was cooked for only 15 minutes.

I came back here to get a reminder of how to make it, and half-and-half is on the recipe. Doubted my memory and used the half and half. It was so unremarkably bland and THIN. Heavy Cream makes all the difference in the world. Possibly this recipe was tweaked since I saved it? Would rate it 3 stars as-is. Fine for a way to use up mushrooms, but nothing I would serve for a special meal. Use the original heavy cream if you want 5 stars.(previous review) I am trying to let the soup finish cooking, but can&#39;t help stealing spoonfuls while it is on the stove. I think ingredient types are key here to get the flavor right. The mushrooms can&#39;t be plain white mushrooms. Their flavor is half the taste. I used Crimean but would have loved to use portabella/baby bellas. I also used sweet onions. (Peruvian) I cannot imagine using white or yellow with this. admittedly I fudged and used a whole onion since this is going to be a base for my green bean casserole, and it has plenty of onion flavor in it. Also, at the suggestion of a friend, I added a roux. Accidently made it very dark, but the toasted flavor was perfect. my chicken stock was from a rotisserie chicken and so I omitted salt and pepper.

My husband and two year old twins ate it up, plus seconds!  After reading the comments I increased the amount of sauce by adding about 3/4 cup white cooking wine and only put about 1/4 cup of lemon juice.  I also upped the oregano and pepper.  To thicken it I added a tablespoon or two of sour cream.  I cooked the shrimp mixture (with frozen shrimp) and pasta on the stove and then put everything in a corningware baking dish to broil it with the bread crumbs and cheese on top.  I personally thought it needed more lemon juice and added it at the table, but my kids and husband thought it was perfect without any add-ons.  It was soooo easy and I will make it again.

They thought it was very good. I had to bake it 10+ minutes longer than the recipe called for and that eliminated the mushy-bread-egg condition that sometimes comes with an overnight egg bake dish. I used Vienna bread and it was fine. My revisions for next time: leave the crusts on (that was time-consuming) and I may layer the top of the bread with thinner slices of cream cheese rather than the 1&#34; cubes. Not everyone around my breakfast table was a big fan of cream cheese chunks. I also thought that I might try using raspberries rather than blueberries to see how that goes. All in all, this was a very nice change from the usual french toast or egg back recipe!"

One thing I ••didn&#39;t••do was follow the recipe to a T. when I read the ingredients it sounded way too sweet (it was going to have a cloying affect). reading all the reviews I found others thought so too after they had made it. decided to cut the powdered sugar in half. didn&#39;t add powdered sugar to the pudding either. Also a change I made was to cut some of the sweetness by adding some creme fresh  to the cream cheese. Another thing I did was melted the butter and I broke up the cookies more fine like a pie crust. I knew if I added the melted butter to the cookie crumbs I&#39;d be able to pat it better into the bottom of my container. I put it in the refrigerator overnight because I plan on serving this to my coworkers for the next few days. also omitted putting the cookie chunks and/or the minI peanut butter cups on top because I didn&#39;t know how well it would travel on a plane and the top treats would just get squashed plus seemed like overkill.my husband was able to just have one bite last night (and a small bite at that) because his stomach was on fire from Mexican restaurant  we went to for dinner. he did say this was very good. I actually think I&#39;ll make this several more times. I wish I would&#39;ve known about it last weekend at our 3yr old&#39;s birthday party but I didn&#39;t. all in all I think this is a hit.dinged a point because of original recipe being too sweet for our taste as written plus additions&amp;subtractions.PS....UPDATE: July 1stmade it again yesterday for a neighbor who is having a 1st time swim/pool filling up party tonight. I use the 5.9oz pudding mix because I want to make it a large dessert for this US celebration weekend party. I crushed &#39;chocolate colored rock candy&#39; on top for color (from WinCo bulk dept). I won&#39;t be here for the party tonight, but hope it will be enjoyed. (ask if you care to know how I changed this recipe to suit our tastes, happy to oblige)."

So this is American Lasagna and it&#39;s delicious - it uses cottage cheese which is not as gritty as ricotta can be.  Lasagna comes from the Greeks - I actually make a Greek lasagna better known as Pastitsio it is layered pasta with ground beef  but when I want American Lasagna I make this recipe.   Did you know the Brits actually found a recipe for Lasagna from the 1390&#39;s?  Each country has perfected their own claim to Lasagna fame.  When the Italians make it in Northern Italy they do not use ricotta cheese, they use a creamy cheese sauce known as besciamella.  Ricotta is used in the Southern region only, this is why many Italians in America use ricotta - most are descendants from Southern Italians.  So even Mario or Giada is making it wrong if you are from Tuscany."

I also used 3 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice as suggested in other reviews plus an extra sprinkle or two.  When I make this in a 11X15 pan I make a recipe and a half so  they do not come out thin.  Or I use a 9 X13 pan and bake for 30 - 35 minutes.   Instead of cream cheese frosting I just use a can of coconut pecan frosting instead.

I just wanted to make a comment in response to the information you shared about stock vs broth. I’m not sure what you’ve shared is accurate. It’s my understanding that both stock and broth are made from the bones, the difference is in the length of time they are cooked. Bone broth is cooked longer with the intention of leeching more nutrients from the bones. Chicken stock is more for flavour, where as broth is more for health benefits. I’m open to being challenged on this, just wanted to put forth a different perspective. Thanks."

First, I use only fresh veggies (except for the peas and pearl onions). It adds time but fresh carrots, parsnips, and Yukon Golds make a difference. Next, I add fresh mushrooms to the onion saute. To keep this flavorful I roast chicken breasts that have been very well seasoned. (Much better than rotisserie chicken and you can add the chicken juices to the stock, upping the flavor considerably.)  I also add a glug of sherry (or white wine, whichever is handy) to the simmering sauce.  Finally, I use the TOF site&#39;s buttery, flaky pie crust as the topper. It doesn&#39;t take long to make (and I only let it sit in the fridge for about 30 minutes) and is delicious on this pie. Yes, I&#39;ve increased the work and time but if you do, this is likely the best pot pie that&#39;s going to come out of your kitchen."

I also tried chocolate chips sprinkled on top of half of the bars (a jelly roll pan makes a lot of bars so I wanted to try them different way).  It was a bad idea. The bars did not have that choc chip pumpkin muffin sense at all. I do agree with many others that the recipe was super easy to put together. At least I have something good to add.

Banana bread should be more of the consistency of something you can pour out into a baking pan.

I have also browned them on the grill and then put them in the oven which is really good as well.

I definitely recommend doubling the recipe if you are making this for a family, so you can enjoy leftovers! The few changes I made: I used Sargento sharp cheddar cheese instead of processed. There was no graininess in the texture, which sometimes can happen with pre-shredded cheese. I am not an expert cook by any means, but I was a little thrown off by the milk/flour mixture. I am used to making a roux, so that is what I did instead. To the roux, I added half and half (instead of milk) and the cheese. I then poured this mixture into the pot with the veggies/broth.

I also use the whole 8 oz of cream cheese and a whole stick of butter in the icing, sticking to the 2 cups of sugar,  which means that they would be slightly less sweet. The frosting just covers them.To the person who asked about a substitute for cannola oil, you can use any kind of oil except for olive.

I&#39;m a free-spirit when it comes to cooking, but baking requires a different approach. I&#39;m astounded that 144 people have had wonderful results, while I&#39;m still trying to figure out which type of cornmeal to use.

Next time though I&#39;ll make an exception and leave them a bit bigger, by request of my dad who loves the walnuts and appreciates my grandpa&#39;s hard work! ;)  I did leave three muffins without nuts just to see the difference and enjoyed them both ways.  I followed a few suggestions from other bakers; I only put in a cup of sugar (3/4 regular and 1/4 brown), I put in three bananas and I added cinnamon (a lot because it&#39;s my favorite!) and I thought they came out great!  I made regular size muffins and would love to figure out how to make a topping for them (maybe granola or something else to add a crunch or caramelized texture), I&#39;m open to suggestions!"

Be warned not to marinate too long with this recipe, though. The citric acid will eventually &#34;cook&#34; the chicken (in fact, this is how ceviche is made). As for freezing the chicken--yes, it can be easier to cut partially frozen chicken. However, if you are having a hard time cutting unfrozen chicken, the culprit is most likely a dull knife. Of course, many of us freeze chicken, but keep in mind that the process of freezing any meat will degrade the meat at least somewhat.

I used 1 loaf of Pepperidge Farm Brown Sugar Cinnamon Bread and I purposely just used the whole loaf, crusts and all the 2nd time around! I used just 1 package of cream cheese and the 2nd time around, I beat the  8-oz. package of cream cheese with 2/3 cup sugar 5 minutes, then I added 6 eggs and 1-1/2 tsp. almond extract.  I scraped the bottom and sides of bowl and then I added 2 cups of milk.  I used 1 PINT of blueberries for both the casserole and for the blueberry sauce.  For the sauce, I&#39;d added 2 Tbsp. bottled lemon juice and I stirred the sugar and cornstarch together before adding the water, then cooked the 3 minutes until it came to a boil.  I stirred in the blueberries, lowered the heat and cooked 10 minutes or untilthe berries burst. After removing from the heat, I stirred in 1 Tbsp. butter. I think that creaming the sugar with the cream cheese makes this dish more flavorful than just cubing it! I&#39;d spritzed the 13x9x2&#34; baking pan with PAM, used a paper towel to spread the spray around and I&#39;d placed the bread cubes in the prepared pan.  Then I added the berries and poured the milk/egg mixture over the bread cubes and berries.  I did allow the French toast to sit, covered, 8 hours on the 2nd time around and then cut vents in the foil to allow the steam to escape!  I also did allow the dish to sit, covered, 1/2 hour before baking, then I baked, covered, 30 minutes at 350o F. and then uncovered the dish and baked 30 minutes more.  For an added touch, I sprinkled 4 tsp. cinnamon-sugar over top on the 2nd time around!  I think that my 2nd time worked much better-the first time, I felt that I could improve this recipe! Using sugar is better for me than using honey or maple syrup!My first time around, I&#39;d used about 9 Tbsp. maple syrup all together and I&#39;d used 2 cups of milk!  I still stuck to 6 eggs, though and the 1-1/2 tsp. almond extract. The first time around I HAD cubed the 8-oz. package of cream cheese and topped with the remaining bread cubes and blueberries!The sauce is GREAT!

I was happy to find a cheese soup recipe that didn&#39;t use broccoli since one of my family members doesn&#39;t like it.  I did double the recipe and it was very good! That being said here&#39;s what I did: I put the onion, celery and carrots and 1 cup of broth in the soup pot and simmered for 10 minutes.  I then added the potatoes, the rest of the broth, the basil and parsley and simmered for another 10 minutes, until the potatoes were done.  To thicken the soup, I then mixed some chicken broth and cornstarch in a cup and added that to the broth/veggies mix, stirring constantly.   I heated the milk and Velveeta in the microwave, stirring occasionally until the cheese was mostly melted.  I added the cheese/milk mix after the potatoes were cooked.  I did not add any salt and I did not use the sour cream.  I ended up with a delicious soup that was a bit healthier and I served it in homemade bread bowls.   Very, very good!"

I added some snipped fresh rosemary and chives to the sauce because we love fresh herbs.  I served over zucchini noodles and asparagus that were sautéed in olive oil, garlic and a sprinkling of parmesan cheese.  It was delightful.

First homemade apple pie and it came out the best I&#39;ve had in my life and that&#39;s not just because I made it haha. There were a few different changes I made and that is 1. I used the homemade pie crust recipe off of crisco container. 2. I skipped the egg white and made a melted butter with sugar and cinnamon to brush on before baking. I know it&#39;s not the healthier choice but it added some great flavor to the crust. 3. I substituted the flour for tapioca because my grandmothers secret is it adds a little extra sweetness and flavor.  Also I forgot to set the timer and didn&#39;t read the cover with foil part so I accidentally skipped out on that so it was uncovered for about 45 minutes. Apples weren&#39;t mushy but also not hard . Right in the middle. I used janigolds and  Mitzu apples that we picked at the orchard.

My 12 year old usually asks for a pineapple upside down cake on his birthday, but he said this year, he may ask for this one instead!  I bought a regular sized cake mix and just split it in half (1.25 cups of the mix).  I baked it cholesterol free by using egg whites and applesauce in place of oil.  Then I followed the instructions as directed, except that I used neufchatel cheese instead of fat free cream cheese because it has even fewer calories, and then I omitted the walnuts because my husband doesn&#39;t like them.  So with even less calories, I increased the serving size so there were 16 slices instead of 20.  It was excellent!  Even my 4-year old ate a whole piece!

Initially, our first thought was, it makes too much for our little family of two, so we decided to cut the recipe in half. It sounded delicious.Once it came out of the oven, that was a different story. The amount of bacon coupled with the sour cream overpowers the dish, so the balance of flavors is too rich. Because the potatoes are such a neutral flavor, they get lost in the casserole. Maybe if you use less of the sour cream and bacon, or more potatoes, that would be the right ratio of bacon to toppings. Also, the presentation wasn&#39;t very appealing, because the whiteness of the sour cream dominates the other colors.Sadly, this recipe will not be added to our recipe box. Happy cooking! :)"

I expected this dish to be delicious based on the standing 5 star rating, but it was even better than I expected. Could hold it&#39;s own against any seafood lasagna I&#39;ve eaten at restaurants. Agree with other comments - great for Christmas, or special occasion meals, as it is really rich and can be pricy. My recipe adaptations based on seafood avail. in KS: ~2.25 lbs. king crab legs* (not Alaskan), 2 lbs. sea scallops (since they were almost half as expensive as bay, and are more tender. Cut into smaller pieces.), 2lbs frozen wild salad shrimp (Costco).  Using the fresh crab was well worth it, once I was done cracking it all - the flavor was amazing! I added 6-8 roasted garlic cloves to the sauce as well. My entire family loved this lasagna, including kids and some pickier people. I will absolutely make this again! *Actually less expensive per lb. than canned crab. I also doubled the recipe as others and so glad I did. I also used DeLallo Organic Italian Whole Wheat Lasagna (no boil) noodles which are my go to for lasagna."

I made this cake for the 4th of July (what&#39;s more American than chocolate cake, right?!) and it was a grand slam, home run with everyone!  I made the recipe exactly as stated except I added a generous dash of cinnamon to the batter with the other dry ingredients.  The cake came out exactly like it looks in the picture on the website.  It is so delicious, I can&#39;t stop eating it!  It&#39;s dense (I love dense cakes as opposed to light and airy, spongy cakes), super moist and full of chocolate flavor.  The frosting pairs perfectly with the cake.   The recipe made three full size, 9 inch layers, I just wrapped one layer in plastic wrap and foil and put it in the freezer for another day.  The frosting was more than enough to generously frost two layers, and then have about a cup leftover.  At first I was stumped because I never heard of &#34;leftover frosting&#34; before, not in my house!  This frosting recipe left enough leftover for us spoon-loving-frosting-eating adults, and more for another time!  I bet I could even frost 1/2 dozen cupcakes with the leftover frosting.  So to sum it up, if you love rich, chocolately, moist, dense cake with tangy, sweet, chocolately frosting of which you will have some leftover, then make this cake!  Thank you for sharing, Sandy!  This cake recipe deserves that winning ribbon!"

I will definitely be making this one again. I put it in a graham cracker crust, and it was off the wall. I do, however have a couple tips to the people who claim the pie was too runny or eggy. When mixing the cheese filling, make sure you beat it smooth as the instructions say. It may take quite a bit of doing, considering you are dealing with cream cheese, especially if it isnt softened completely. Make sure there are no chunks left and that it is nice and whipped. The same goes for the caramel topping. I also only used 2 and a half eggs instead of 3 in the topping mixture. let the pecans swim, but dont drown them. I didnt completely use the entire topping mixture on mine. Finally, make sure your cheesecake is completely baked to the middle, and make sure you cool and refridge the pie for the proper amount of time."

One person asked if anyone has used anything other than Velveeta.  If you mean name brand vs non name brand then yes I have.  I have found that Velveeta has a much better flavor in the soup then the off brands that I have used."

It is an exceptionally easy recipe to make, the cupcakes were delicious and the icing was good also. If you wish to speed the icing process up a bit you can place the cooked part in ice and use an electric mixer. This way you can get to the finished product sooner.

I used a half sheet pan, I think 15-1/2 x 11-1/4, and it was the perfect size for bar thickness. Baked mine for 23 minutes, rotating pan with 8 minutes left. One rack lower than middle of oven. Nice medium brown on top. Put in the cold garage to cool quickly. I had about 1-1/2 cups of leftover cream cheese frosting I&#39;d used for cookies. Very thick so added maybe a good half a cup of soured milk till the right consistency for a glaze. Spread over the mostly cooled bars, cut into 40 bars which yielded 2 inch sized bars.

However, I am confused. I went out yesterday and carefully selected all of the ingredients. If you look at the ingredients list there is no mention of provolone; then when you get to step 3 you are supposed to layer with provolone. Provolone is similar to mozzarella, but the instructions call for provolone AND mozzarella. Note the recipe also calls for 1/2 c of Parmesan cheese. No where in the instructions is that ingredient mentioned. Finally, the sauce is to be simmered for one hour. Unless you want it burned, don&#39;t plan on that. It is very thick and I had to stop with nine minutes to go. Obviously this recipe was not kitchen-tested."

Just a little twist from this recepi.Use lime juice (2tblspoon) instead of orange juice. Ommit tomato sauce.  Substitude with tamarind juice (2tblspoon) if you did not use lime juice at all. Before you fry the chicken with corn oil, oat it with 1teaspoon of tumeric powder 1teaspoon of salt. When chicken is done, scoop out the chicken. Use the same oil to cook the sauce. Remember to season the sauce with salt &amp; sugar (up to you). Put the chicken into the sauce and stir a while. The sauce should be sweet &amp; spicy. There are many version of Asian style.
